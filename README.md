# Lit Fibre Front End Developer Exercises

There are two exercises we'd like you to complete:

### Programming

This is a purely JavaScript exercise, and it's designed to show how us how you approach problem solving, your knowledge of common JS patterns and your programming style generally.

To get started, open `programming-exercise/script.js` in your preferred editor, and open `programming-exercise/index.html` in a browser, with the console window open. The exercise instructions are in the comments in `programming-exercise/script.js`.

### React

This exercise is designed to test both your knowledge of React and of CSS. The premise here is similar to the programming exercise: you need to fix part of the online ordering system for a cafe, however this time you'll be working on the web interface itself.

To get started, open the `react-exercise` folder in VS Code, and run `npm start` as you would normally with any React project. The files you'll be interested in are `src/App.jsx`, `src/App.css`, `src/components/ProductTile.jsx` and `src/components/ProductTile.css`.

You need to create an instance of the `ProductTile` component for every entry in the `products` array in `react-exercise/src/App.jsx` (there are a few hard-coded examples there already to show you which props to use). Then, fix the layout issues using CSS. You can find the target layout in `React exercise target.png` in this folder, but feel free to get creative if you want to try a different design: The important thing is that all the product data is visible and consistently laid out as in that image.

Please avoid using third party libraries for either of these tasks, and ideally we'd like you to use FlexBox to solve the layout.
